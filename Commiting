Open your genymotion , run the android 9 device (you may run into a problem like IP NOT ASSIGNED etc , FOR THAT)
Disable the hyperV on your windows device as in windows 10 and 11 its commanly the problem, go to this link for that "https://support.genymotion.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005742597-The-VirtualBox-DHCP-server-has-not-assigned-an-IP-address-to-the-virtual-device"
Drag and drop the malicious file in the virtual mobile phone window.
Go to Ahmyth and click on open the lab , from there we can take photos from front and back cameras , record audio etc.
You can test this on the multiple machines created in genymotion.
As from assessment when we try to install the malicious file on android 14,15 it refuses to download it, showcasing advanced security features.
