Run ahmyth 
First we have to build our malicious apk file.
In the APK builder Tap in Ahmyth , in the server ip write your device ip (virtual machine ip , use ifconfig to find it).
Once you check out the permissions you want to gain after connecting to the target device. 
Click on build.
The apk will be stoed in your device in the home directory in the ahmyth folder.
Now in a new terminal , cd /AhMyth/Output.
python3 -m http.server 80  (this command will start a local python server on which only local devices , meaning same network devices can connect).
On the Ahmyth tab , on the victims tab , click on the listen tab.(Ahmyth automatically listens on port 80 , default port)
NOTE!!! (Remember to put network setting to bridged while using this your ip would be like e.g 192.168.100.66 ) You can also take help from a yt video .
If you are doing this on your personal device (mobile phone) , go to your browser and type "" your linux device ip and : port number the server was hosted on ""
Do the same if you want to do it on genymotion but type the ip in your browser and download the file on your computer.
