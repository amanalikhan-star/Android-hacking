As Ahmyth is not compatible with the built in kali java 21 (you can check your machine's java version by " java -version ")
For java 11 and configuration as default sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
sudo update-alternatives --config java (see all available java version on the system)
select 1 
then run java -version (it will show 11 as the version number) 
cd Downloads (thats probably where the ahmyth is installed if not cd to the dir or location where the tool is downloaded)
sudo apt intall ./paste file name

run ahmyth my simply typing "ahmyth" (it should change color)
